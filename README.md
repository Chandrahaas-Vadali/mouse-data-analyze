# mouse-data-analyze
Takes the data from mouselogger V2 and extracts different features

Here is how the code works -

1. Checks when the logger file was last edited.
2. Checks how long the logger was logging the data in this file.
3. Create multiple multidimensional arrays to store different features for each hour.
